# YazBot

**Personal Discord selfbot** written in [Python / JavaScript]

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING – READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

This is a **selfbot** — it automates a **user account**, not a bot account created via the Developer Portal.

→ Selfbots are **explicitly against Discord's Terms of Service** (automation / client modification / API abuse)
→ Using this **can and very likely will** result in permanent account termination
→ Detection has become significantly more aggressive in 2025–2026
→ **I am not responsible** for any bans, data loss, or consequences

Use at your own risk — preferably only on **throwaway accounts**.

This bot exists **purely for version control / personal backup / educational purposes**.
Do **NOT** use this code to harass, spam, raid, mass-DM, token-grab, or break any laws / ToS.
