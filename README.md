# YazBot

**Personal Discord selfbot** written in [Python / JavaScript]

**⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING – READ THIS FIRST ⚠️**

This is a **selfbot** — it automates a **user account**, not a bot account created via the Developer Portal.

→ Selfbots are **explicitly against Discord's Terms of Service** (section on automation / client modification / API abuse).  
→ Using this **can and very likely will** result in permanent account termination.  
→ Detection has become significantly more aggressive in 2025–2026 (behavior heuristics, TLS fingerprinting, rate-limit patterns, mass reports).  
→ **I am not responsible** for any bans, data loss, or other consequences. Use at your own risk — preferably only on throwaway accounts.

This bot  exists **purely for version control / personal backup**.  
Do **not** use this code to harass, spam, raid, mass-DM, token-grab, or break any laws / ToS.
